## About Me

Hi there! I'm a systems and backend developer with a deep focus on performance, reliability, and low-level engineering. My work revolves around C and C++.

I'm passionate about building lean, robust software — from custom networking stacks to operating system kernels and emulators. I care about understanding things at the metal and writing code that runs efficiently and predictably.

### What I'm Working On

Lately, I’ve been developing a **general-purpose C container library**, written from scratch with performance, flexibility, and clean design in mind. It includes dynamic arrays, iterators, search and sort utilities, and more — all modular, tested, and minimal by design. Once refactored and polished, I plan to open source it as the foundation for a broader suite of libraries.

If you're working on something interesting, feel free to reach out — I'm always happy to connect with fellow developers who like building things close to the metal.
